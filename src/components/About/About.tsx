                    Heyo! My name is Michael and I'm currently a third year Computer Science student at the University of Guelph!
                    I'm a huge fan of React, and full-stack development in general. I also love solving algorithmic problems - it gives
                    me a feeling of euphoria once I finally get a working solution. I had a previous Co-op term at Tulip as a Backend Software
                    Developer - I loved the people, the work, and the atmosphere. Aside from my passion for programming, I'm an avid gym-goer,
                    I like to lift heavy weight - "ain't nothin' like a peanut" - Ronnie Coleman. I also love all types of sports, hiking, kdramas,
                    anime, and anything nerdy. <br /> <br />
